This is my first project working on the next level of FrontEnd Mentor.

I had a lot of fun making the grid and it went pretty smoothly. Because I took some time to think about it, I was also able to make it responsive quite easily. Next time I might going mobile first. Just as a challenge

Was also trying SASS which was really helpful in keeping stuff organized. I'm looking at doing some bigger projects and already SASS is proving pretting helpful

I had never made a hamburger menu yet, so that was also fun to experiment with. Not perfect yet, but getting there hopefully.
